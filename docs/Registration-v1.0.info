Keyword List example: 

KeywordList = "/cycling^/software development^/programming^/fitness^/health^/illustration^/music^/guitar^/rock^/pop^"
NoKeywords = 10
NoWords = [1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

Original = "Cycling,Software Development, Programming,Fitness. Health , Illustration,  Music, Guitar, Rock and Pop."
- check that there are no unwanted characters : return boolean 1/0
- convert uppercase to lowercase
- check spacing errors

- Remove commas for end-of-keyword placeholder
Common errors:
1. spelling mistake
2. double spacing
3. space before comma
4. full-stop instead of comma
5. words like is, are, they, that, got, etc.
6. and without a comma before last word.


Emit characters = "!\"£$%^&*()_+-=¬`[{]};:\'@#~<>?/\|"

if (KeywordIndex.NoWords[KeywordNo] = 1) CheckWordisNot();
if (KeywordIndex.NoWords[KeywordNo] >= 2) { while (x < strlen(keyword)) { if (keyword[x] != " " ) CheckWordisNot.one(keyword, x); x++; CheckWordisNot.two(keyword, x); x++;}}

Keyword Rules:
A space indicates the end of a word
if a space is followed by a comma or full stop, the space is emitted and will not do a word count
if a space is reached and is not followed by a space or a comma the word count is incremented
if the character is a comma the word count is incremented where the Keyword Index will then shift on to the next Keyword Number in order
